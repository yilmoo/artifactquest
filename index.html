        You have <strong>2 lives</strong> per question. On your first try, you’ll learn which parts (object and/or year) are correct without full details; on your final try, you'll receive complete feedback.<br><br>
        <em>Scoring:</em><br>
        • <strong>Object Guess:</strong> Correct on first try = 3 points; if correct only on your second try = 1 point; else 0.<br>
        • <strong>Year Guess:</strong> Exactly correct = 2 points; within 5 years = 1.5 points; within 10 = 1 point; within 15 = 0.5 point; otherwise, 0.
